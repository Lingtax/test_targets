# test targets

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This repo contains a very bad tidytext analysis. It is intended as a
starting point for someone learning the
[`targets`](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html)
workflow.

The objective is to take the code in the report in `~ /analysis`, and
split it into targets that produce the same report.
